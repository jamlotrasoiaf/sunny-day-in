## Hello!
I am Frodo, and uh, I have an exam in 2 hours so maybe I should focus on that. But anyway, I'm looking forward to having fun with this blog! Will update this later with how my exam went

That's about it! Sunny out!

## Well....
.....and I'm back a few minutes later.  
Worrying about exam.  
Worrying about getting home.  
*Worrying about everything ngl*  
Sigh. I hope at least the exam today goes smoothly.

## And a separate set of worries....
....by which I mean I haven't switched for a few days.  
And every time I don't switch for a few days I feel like I'm faking.  
Oh, Toki just called me "stupid"? Maybe I'm not faking it haha.  
Still, who knows? Not me!

Anyway, this isn't the time to worry about all this. Exam in like an hour. Need to be ready.

So yeah. Sunny out!
